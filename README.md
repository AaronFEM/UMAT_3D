ABAQUS Subroutine for the Implementation of Thermomechanical Constitutive Model for Shape Memory Alloys

The baseline model implemented is the one published by Lagoudas et al.:
Dimitris Lagoudas, Darren Hartl, Yves Chemisky, Luciano Machado, Peter Popov
Constitutive model for the numerical analysis of phase transformation in polycrystalline shape memory alloys
Int J Plast, 32 (2012), pp. 155-183

Proper modifications of the baseline model have been considered based on the work published by:
